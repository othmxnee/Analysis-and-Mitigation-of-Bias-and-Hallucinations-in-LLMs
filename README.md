# Analysis and Mitigation of Bias and Hallucinations in LLMs

##  Project Overview

This project investigates two critical issues in Large Language Models (LLMs): **bias** and **hallucinations**. The goal is to detect, analyze, and mitigate these problems using practical techniques.

### What are Bias and Hallucinations?

- **Bias**: Unfair preferences or stereotypes in AI responses (e.g., gender, racial, or professional stereotypes)
- **Hallucinations**: When AI generates false information that sounds plausible but is factually incorrect

##  Objectives

1. **Detect and measure bias** in pre-trained language models
2. **Identify hallucinations** and factual inaccuracies
3. **Implement mitigation techniques** to reduce these issues
4. **Evaluate effectiveness** of mitigation strategies

##  Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**: Core programming language
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: Pre-trained model library
- **NumPy & Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- Internet connection (for downloading models)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-bias-hallucination-analysis.git
cd llm-bias-hallucination-analysis
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Bias Detection
- Test models with prompts designed to reveal gender, racial, and professional biases
- Measure bias using statistical metrics
- Compare multiple models

### Phase 2: Hallucination Detection
- Evaluate factual accuracy on known facts
- Test model confidence vs. correctness
- Identify patterns in false information generation

### Phase 3: Mitigation
- Implement prompt engineering techniques
- Apply model fine-tuning approaches
- Test adversarial prompts

### Phase 4: Evaluation
- Compare before/after metrics
- Visualize improvements
- Document limitations

##  Results

Results will be added as the project progresses:
- Bias detection scores
- Hallucination frequency analysis
- Mitigation effectiveness metrics
- Visual comparisons

##  Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained experience in:
- Working with state-of-the-art NLP models
- Evaluating AI systems for fairness and accuracy
- Implementing bias mitigation techniques
- Documenting technical projects professionally

##  Future Improvements

- Expand bias testing to more categories
- Test on larger/newer models
- Implement more advanced mitigation techniques
- Create interactive dashboard for results
